Motion Tracking and Face Detection
This project implements a real-time motion tracking and face detection system using OpenCV. The program captures video from a webcam, detects motion and faces, logs motion events, and saves frames with overlays when motion is detected.

Features
Real-Time Motion Detection: Uses background subtraction to identify moving objects.
Face Detection: Implements a Haar Cascade to detect human faces in the video feed.
Event Logging: Captures and timestamps frames when motion is detected.
Customizable Sensitivity: Adjust motion sensitivity during runtime.
Video Recording: Saves the output video with motion and face overlays.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/motion-tracking-and-face-detection.git
cd motion-tracking-and-face-detection
2. Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Program
Run the script to start the motion tracking and face detection system:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Usage Instructions
Start the Program: Launch the program, and it will begin real-time detection.
Keyboard Controls:
Press 'q' to quit.
Press 'u' to increase motion sensitivity.
Press 'd' to decrease motion sensitivity.
Outputs:
Motion-detected frames are saved with timestamps (e.g., motion_detected_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.jpg).
The processed video feed is saved as motion_tracking_output.avi.
Output Files
Motion-Detected Images: Images with motion and face annotations, saved locally.
Video File: The program saves the annotated video feed as motion_tracking_output.avi in the working directory.

Customization
You can adjust the following parameters in the code to suit your needs:

Motion Threshold: Modify the motion_threshold variable to filter out smaller movements.
Frame Skip: Change the frame_skip value for performance optimization.
Resolution: Update the CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH and CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT settings for higher/lower video resolution.
Known Issues
False positives might occur due to sudden lighting changes.
Face detection accuracy depends on webcam quality and lighting.
